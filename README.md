* Channel News Asia Singapore
    * This pulls data from Channel News Asia's [RSS feed](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/rss) and converts the day's article into a format optimised for ebook readers such as the Kindle. I have removed all advertisement tags from CNA's website from the RSS data for ease of reading. 
    * Limitations: Due to the complexity of CNA's website, I am currently unable to retrieve images for the articles. However, the image captions are included in the articles generated. 

## kindlemail
This script can be utilised to send your MOBI files generated by Calibre to your Kindle email. It is currently only tested using a Gmail account, but it should work for all email servers that are SMTP enabled.
